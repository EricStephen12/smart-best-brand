        question: "Do you sell original mattresses?",

        question: "How long does delivery take?",
        answer: "For locations within Abuja and Benin, delivery typically takes 24-48 hours. For other locations, it may take 3-5 business days depending on the size of the order and the brand's availability."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I pay for my order?",
        answer: "You can pay securely online via our integrated payment gateway or opt for the 'Order on WhatsApp' method where we can arrange for bank transfers. We currently do not support Pay on Delivery for most large furniture items."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I return a mattress?",
        answer: "Due to hygiene reasons, mattresses cannot be returned once the nylon seal has been removed. However, if there is a factory defect, we will facilitate a replacement through the manufacturer's warranty process."
    },
